- this is pretty useful only in 2 cases
- stage and prod are in same namespace
- DB to pod app communication

- here we are trying to achieve namespace scoped isolation.
  * we have two namespace prodarcab and production
  * we dont want to communicate from production to prodarcab
- manifest file allow.yaml
- if applied it will block all traffic all pods !
- for production to prodarcab work u need to label that production with label " role: production"
- kubectl label namespace/production role=production
- so ensure that all namespaces that needs to communicate to prodarcab be labelled
